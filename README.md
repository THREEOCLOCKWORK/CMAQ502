Community Multiscale Air Quality Model version 5.0.2 (April 2014)

CMAQ is an active open-source development project of the U.S. EPA Atmospheric Science Modeling Division that consists of a suite of programs for conducting air quality model simulations. CMAQ is supported and distributed by the CMAS Center.

CMAQ combines current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling with multi-processor computing techniques in an open-source framework to deliver fast, technically sound estimates of ozone, particulates, toxics, and acid deposition.

CMAQ version 5.0.2 is an incremental update to CMAQ version 5.0.1 that includes several changes to the science algorithms in the base model and new diagnostic/scientific modules. The instrumented versions of the model provide CMAQ users with diagnostic tools for help in interpreting model performance and results. Community versions of the model include new science algorithms contributed by development groups outside of EPA.
